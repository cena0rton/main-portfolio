              <p>
                I'm a BITS Pilani graduate and a curious being who thrives on blending logic with creativity. I approach
                tech with a non-linear mindset always exploring, reading, writing, or making music between lines of
                code.
              </p>
              <p>
              I have experience with the MERN stack and Java Spring Boot, but at heart, Iâ€™m a product architect. I use code to shape ideas into real, usable things driven by clarity, minimalism, and a belief that good design should feel as natural as it looks.
